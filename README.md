# Sajujya Gangopadhyay TSWD Portfolio

Hi  everyone! 

This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University! I hope to work on data visualizations that focus on public policy issues, especially at the intersection of immigration and how it affects labor markets around the world. For our reference, here are the links to this page, and my repository!

# About me
I am Sajujya, a graduate student in the MSPPM - DA program at CMU. I am originally from India, where I have experience as a policy research analyst! Over the summer, I interned for a management consulting firm in their Labor and Employment practice, where my work revolved around identifying and correcting hiring, pay and reduction in force disparities across racial and socio-economic groups for Fortune 500 companies who were undergoing civil and class action lawsuits. 

# What I hope to learn
I have had previous experience using Tableau. Therefore I want to use this course to hone my skills in visualization, specifically using colors and graphics to create clear, compelling and intuitive graphics. Below are some of the skills I want to take away from the class:

1. Choosing the Right Chart Types: Understand when and why to use different chart types such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc and to go a step further and explore newer charts and graphs. 

2. Data Visualization Tools: Gain further proficiency in data visualization tools like Tableau while simultaneously using Python to add variation and finer modifications. 

3. Color Theory: Learn how to use colors effectively in your visualizations to convey information, highlight important data, and maintain readability.

4. Typography: Understand how to use fonts, text size, and formatting to add context and clarity to your visualizations.

5. Storytelling with Data: Learn how to tell a compelling story using data, making it easier for others to understand and draw conclusions from your visualizations

6. Feedback and Iteration: Learn how to gather feedback on my own visualizations and iterate to improve their effectiveness and usability.

## Assignment 1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, I analyzed Government Debt data from various sources and visualized them using the built-in OECD Visualizer, and Flourish. Let me know if you like it!




## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique_by_design)
For this assignment, I critiqued the visualization created by the White House in 2016 to depict the U.S. Government Budget Spending. 

## Final Project Part I: [AI: Outgrowing Your Expectations Faster Than a Kardashian Breakup!](final-project-part-one)
Greetings, I am the architect behind this comprehensive data visualization endeavor, meticulously designed to elucidate the remarkable growth and maturation of Artificial Intelligence throughout the 21st century. My deep-seated passion for AI and data analytics has led to the creation of this project, wherein I've diligently curated and transformed complex data into a visually compelling narrative. Embark with me on an intellectual voyage that chronicles the ascendancy of AI, from its nascent stages to its current stature as a transformative force in the technological landscape. Join me in unveiling the captivating world of AI through the lens of this project!

## Final Project Part II: Balancing Progress and Principles: [Navigating the AI Evolution with an Ethical Compass]final-project-part-two)
In this second part, I have created most of the visualizations I aim to use and have used them to create a compelling storyboard using ShortHand. This part has focused primarily on identifying a target audience and catering my story to bring out elements of persuation.
