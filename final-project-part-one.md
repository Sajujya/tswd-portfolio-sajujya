<h1 align="center">Artificial Intelligence: Scaling Up Faster Than a Viral TikTok Trend!</h1>

## Outline of the Project

In this project, I embark on a comprehensive exploration of the incredible evolution of Artificial Intelligence in our modern world. I kick things off by tracing AI's origins and significant milestones. Here, I wish to look at the major milestones in the development of AI, and compare it on a timescale - a comparison of Training Computation with respect to time. This visualization(s) would clearly demonstrate the logarithmic growth of training computation that the industry has gone through.

In the next section, I start looking at how the research in AI has unfolded over time - from the early 2010s to 2020 (this is a data limitation). This visualization seeks to identify hotspots for AI development around the world, and looks at the growth of these hotspots over time. For this visualization, I imagine a color changing map of the world where the darker areas represent the hotspots. 

As the project unfolds further, I take a closer look at AI's profound impact on various industries, from healthcare to finance. Here, I my plan extends its gaze globally, comparing AI development across regions and highlighting key players and collaborative efforts. I aspire to do this by comparing the investment in AI by the major players in the market over time and per industry. Additioanlly, I plan to look at the countries which have Established vs Developing National Artificial Intelligence Strategies. 

Finally, my plan is to transition into the societal implications of AI. This would include the global perception of AI technology over time. This would involve an analysis of the major AI controversies in the last 10 years, coupled with survey data asking respondents to reply to quesions like "Will AI help or harm people in the next 20 years". 

My Target Audience for this project is the general populace, and my goal is to inform them of the development of AI in the last 20 years from a variety of lenses, and the scale of that development. Additionally, my project also would aim to demistify popular misconceptions about the industry, and how, if at all it will affect the Future of Work.
