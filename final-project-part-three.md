# The Final Data Story
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/sajujya_final_project/index.html

# Changes made since Part II

Since Part II, I have implemented some chages to the general structure of my Data Story. These in specific include:

1. Including connecting slides that increase the readability of the story. This is done so that the story does not need an explicit narrator if I have to explain it to someone.

2. Adding in a section about "How does the uncontrolled growth of AI harm people?"

3. Added in more pages describing How AI could be Harmful to the society and what some of the recent happenings with regards to the harmful use of AI were. With this section, I hope to drive home the point that the unregulated growth of AI has already had implications on the daily lives of people around the world.  

In conclusion, these were all the new changes I introduced specifically for Part III of the project. 

## The audience
My user research interviews really helped me solidify who my target audience for this project was. After the initial feedback I received from my user research interviews, I identified the following group as my target audience for this project: 

#### Defined Target Audience 
My target audience for advocating the need or a Bipartisan Bill on the Regulation of AI consists of the general populace of the US who are AI-conscious. They should ideally satisfy one or more of the following criteria: 

1. **Interested in AI:** AI conscious individuals are those who actively follow the developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science as a whole. These people need not neccessarily be coders, but are interested in the field and its applications to and implications on society. 

2. **Policy Concern:** People who are interested in the policy implications of AI, especially the concern of privacy in the age of AI. The website has an exlusive focus on the Major Controversies that has risen from the field of AI in the last 20 years. So, if the person (people) is interested in the societal and policy implications of AI, they would benefit from understanding what are the relevant challenges that the field is facing and how can we get around them, instead of halting the development all together.

3. **Bipartisanship Advocates:** This audience values bipartisan cooperation in government and understands that AI policy should transcend political divides. They believe that crafting effective AI legislation requires collaboration between both major political parties.

In identifying this audience, I used feedback I received from my user research interviews. Additional research on similar AI related websites and the information that they offer also helped me narrow down my focus from the _general populace_ to this more concrete definition of the audience. 

After this identification, I could add in information that may feel a little abstruse to some sections of the population, particularly the people who are not interested in the development and societal implications of AI. This helped me make my data story leaner and more efficient.
