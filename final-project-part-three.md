# Changes made since Part II

Since Part II, I have implemented some chages to the general structure of my Data Story. These in specific include:

1. Including connecting slides that increase the readability of the story. This is done so that the story does not need an explicit narrator if I have to explain it to someone.

2. Adding in a section about "How does the uncontrolled growth of AI harm people?"

3. Added in more pages describing How AI could be Harmful to the society and what some of the recent happenings with regards to the harmful use of AI were. With this section, I hope to drive home the point that the unregulated growth of AI has already had implications on the daily lives of people around the world.  

In conclusion, these were all the new changes I introduced specifically for Part III of the project. 

## The audience
My user research interviews really helped me solidify who my target audience for this project was. After the initial feedback I received from my user research interviews, I identified the following group as my target audience for this project: 

#### Defined Target Audience 
My target audience for advocating the need or a Bipartisan Bill on the Regulation of AI consists of the general populace of the US who are AI-conscious. They should ideally satisfy one or more of the following criteria: 

1. **Interested in AI:** AI conscious individuals are those who actively follow the developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science as a whole. These people need not neccessarily be coders, but are interested in the field and its applications to and implications on society. 

2. **Policy Concern:** People who are interested in the policy implications of AI, especially the concern of privacy in the age of AI. The website has an exlusive focus on the Major Controversies that has risen from the field of AI in the last 20 years. So, if the person (people) is interested in the societal and policy implications of AI, they would benefit from understanding what are the relevant challenges that the field is facing and how can we get around them, instead of halting the development all together.

3. **Bipartisanship Advocates:** This audience values bipartisan cooperation in government and understands that AI policy should transcend political divides. They believe that crafting effective AI legislation requires collaboration between both major political parties.

In identifying this audience, I used feedback I received from my user research interviews. Additional research on similar AI related websites and the information that they offer also helped me narrow down my focus from the _general populace_ to this more concrete definition of the audience. 

After this identification, I could add in information that may feel a little abstruse to some sections of the population, particularly the people who are not interested in the development and societal implications of AI. This helped me make my data story leaner and more efficient. 


## Final design decisions
1. During my user research, specifically for the question, _Does the wireframe and storyboard flow logically from one section to the next?_, I got feedback that revolved around adding some more pages to make the transition from one section to another easier. Therefore, I added some single line pages in between sections to create a story that the end-user can understand without them needing me to explain it.

2. During my user research, I realized that one of the things people really wanted to see was _how_ unregulated AI practices could actually harm them. To factor this in to my final presentation, I added a section on that. This section currently includes contrversies like the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This section currently serves as a reminder that irresponsible and unregulated growth of AI practices has already crept into academia and industry alike. This also extends to art, where AI generated art is currently under heavy fire, with the main question being whether AI generated art should be considered real art.

3. Finally, to make my Call to Action more specific, I linked it to an actual petition by Change.org that is collecting signatures to demand an AI Bill of Rights. Even though currently there exists an AI Bill of Rights that establishes guardrails for the development of AI in the US, the current version suffers from uneven progress being made in several industries, the most blatant ones being education and healthcare. 

# Final thoughts
_Navigating the AI Revolution with an Ethical Compass_ was a truly transformative journey that opened my eyes to the intricacies of AI and the profound impact it has on our society. Additionally, Telling Stories with Data equipped me with valuable skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. All of our class exercises, and the assignments from the Good Charts workbook in a way culminated into my final project and allowed me to explore the ethical dimensions of AI, a topic of immense importance in our rapidly evolving technological landscape.

The User research and interviews played a pivotal role in this project, enabling me to gain deep insights into people's concerns and perspectives about AI. Engaging with individuals from various backgrounds allowed me to appreciate the nuanced ways in which AI is shaping our lives, both positively and negatively. Furthermore, the feedback I received opened my eyes to the fact that there are often several interpretations of the same graphics, visualizations and text. 

Through this project, I learned the power of data-driven storytelling in conveying complex ethical issues. It highlighted the need for transparency, accountability, and responsible AI development. Navigating this landscape required not only technical expertise but also a strong ethical foundation to guide AI's evolution. 

Finally, this project reaffirmed my commitment to championing ethical AI and helped me understand the importance of bridging the gap between technology and humanity. It was an enriching experience that inspired me to continue exploring and advocating for the responsible use of AI in our society. In a world increasingly defined by data and AI, this project underscored the importance of not just navigating but _charting_ our course with an ethical compass.
