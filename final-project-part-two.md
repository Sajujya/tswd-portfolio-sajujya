# Balancing Progress and Principles: Navigating the AI Evolution with an Ethical Compass

### Wireframes / storyboards

I started with defining my target audience, and crafting the story around that particular narrative. My aim in this project is to convince my readers of a need for a Bipartisan AI Bill that demands Responsible Development of AI by all actors involved in the devdelopment and deployment of large scale artificial intelligence systems that would go on to shape the society of tomorrow.

## User research 

### Target audience
My target audience for advocating the need for a Bipartisan Bill on AI consists of the general population of the US who are AI-conscious. I identified them as my target audience through the following criteria:

1. **Interested in AI:** AI-conscious individuals are those who actively follow developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies. They are genuinely interested in the field and its implications for society. Therefore, I have comparatively lesser ground to cover while catching them up with the recent developments in the field. 

2. **Awareness of AI's Impact:** This audience is aware of AI's potential to transform various industries, create economic opportunities, and disrupt existing job markets. They understand both the benefits and challenges associated with AI adoption.

3. **Policy Concerns:** AI-conscious people are concerned about the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. They recognize the need for appropriate regulations and safeguards to ensure AI is used responsibly and safely.

4. **Bipartisanship Advocates:** This audience values bipartisan cooperation in government and understands that AI policy should transcend political divides. They believe that crafting effective AI legislation requires collaboration between both major political parties.

In targeting this audience, I aim to engage with their existing knowledge and concerns about AI and emphasizing the importance of a bipartisan approach to address the complex challenges and opportunities presented by AI technology - as done by several other developed nations around the world. 

Following this criteria, the people I selected for conducting this User Research were of the following demographic: 

1. Male, Graduate Student, Early 30s, AI Enthusiast
2. 

### Interview script

For my interviews, I tried to identify the overall first impression of my storyboard, whether the target audience is able to identify the core message, whether the visual elements work in cohesion, and whether the story as a whole makes sense. 

Now, let's look at what happened in the interviews!

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand users' first impressions and overall sentiment |  What is your initial impression of the wireframe and storyboard?|
| Assess if the project's core message is clear and prominent. | Can you easily identify the main message or objective of the project from the wireframe and storyboard? |
| Identify potential areas of confusion or ambiguity in the design. | Are there any elements that are confusing or unclear to you in the wireframe and storyboard?|
| Ensure that visual elements enhance user engagement and understanding. | Are the visual elements, such as images and graphics, engaging and relevant? | 
| Assess the suitability of the chosen color palette. | Is the color scheme appropriate for the project's tone and message? | 
| Determine if users are encouraged to take desired actions. | Are the calls-to-action (CTAs) clear and compelling? |
| Evaluate the overall narrative flow of the design. | Does the wireframe and storyboard flow logically from one section to the next? |
| Identify and address any technical issues that hinder usability. | Are there any technical issues or glitches that you've encountered while interacting with the wireframe and storyboard? |
| Collect actionable feedback for refining the design. | What changes or improvements would you suggest to make the wireframe and storyboard more effective in conveying the message and engaging the target audience? | 


### Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 	What is your initial impression of the wireframe and storyboard? |   The title is a little abstruse for someone who is not in touch with the development of AI. Overall, pretty positive. You're trying to convinvce people to vote for a bill that calls for a clear ethical guideline around AI development, and the creation of a binding, national and international regulatory framework. |             |             |
| Can you easily identify the main message or objective of the project from the wireframe and storyboard? |  Yes, and no. Yes, in the sense that once I have scrolled through the entire website, I know what you're talking about. However, I felt that you took a bit too long to get to the point.|              |             |
|  Are there any elements that are confusing or unclear to you in the wireframe and storyboard?| You talk about an ethical compass, however, there is no mention of an ethical compass anywhere else in the storyboard right now. It feels like you have left that upto interpretation - which in my opinion makes your Call to Action weaker than it should be.|             |             |
| Are the visual elements, such as images and graphics, engaging and relevant?| Yes. But I see multiple bar charts right now. Although it makes sense, I feel there could be other graphs that you could try as well. |             |             |
|Is the color scheme appropriate for the project’s tone and message?|  I think so. I like the dark theme. However, I still think there is a lack of homogenization of the color scheme throughout the page. I don't know what exactly it is that makes me feel this way.|             |             |
| Are the calls-to-action (CTAs) clear and compelling?|  The Call to Action is clear. However, I feel there is still some room to make it more compelling with other evidence of AI malfeasance, and oversight, and how it affects the people in the US.|             |             |
| Does the wireframe and storyboard flow logically from one section to the next? | Yes. But I think there should be a couple of more guiding slides in-between that take me from one point to another, and walk me through how you would've, if you were explaining it to me. |             |             |
|  Are there any technical issues or glitches that you’ve encountered while interacting with the wireframe and storyboard? | Nothin that I could find, no. I feel like reading/interpreting the bar chart race was a little difficult given the speed at which it changed|             |             |
|  What changes or improvements would you suggest to make the wireframe and storyboard more effective in conveying the message and engaging the target audience?| You might try out some different types of visualizations, instead of using the bar plot more than once. Addtionally, as an audience member, I would also like to know how a world without AI ethics impacts the general public. You could use some examples of AI bias - racially and socially and how it's affecting people around the world. |             |             |


## Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The narrative flow currently is somewhat discontinuous. Especially at the beginning of the project. | In Part III, I aim to add some more connecting slides, that would make the narrative even more clear. With regards to this point, what I'm trying to achieve is that the ShortHand story will speak for itself, without me needing to explain any particular point. |
|  There is a logical gap between how the lack of such an AI bill affects the general populace.|In Part III, I would like to ideally add 2 more slides that describe how the future of the world looks like without supervision in the AI industry. Given that data can be difficult to find for this particular scenario, I am thinking about adding images from various articles, and recent incidents of social and racial bias by different AI systems around the world. |

| ...add more rows as necessary            |                                                                                 |
