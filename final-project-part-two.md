# Balancing Progress and Principles: Navigating the AI Evolution with an Ethical Compass

### Wireframes / storyboards

I started with defining my target audience, and crafting the story around that particular narrative. My aim in this project is to convince my readers of a need for a Bipartisan AI Bill that demands Responsible Development of AI by all actors involved in the devdelopment and deployment of large scale artificial intelligence systems that would go on to shape the society of tomorrow.

## User research 

### Target audience
My target audience for advocating the need for a Bipartisan Bill on AI consists of the general population of the US who are AI-conscious. I identified them as my target audience through the following criteria:

1. **Interested in AI:** AI-conscious individuals are those who actively follow developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies. They are genuinely interested in the field and its implications for society. Therefore, I have comparatively lesser ground to cover while catching them up with the recent developments in the field. 

2. **Awareness of AI's Impact:** This audience is aware of AI's potential to transform various industries, create economic opportunities, and disrupt existing job markets. They understand both the benefits and challenges associated with AI adoption.

3. **Policy Concerns:** AI-conscious people are concerned about the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. They recognize the need for appropriate regulations and safeguards to ensure AI is used responsibly and safely.

4. **Bipartisanship Advocates:** This audience values bipartisan cooperation in government and understands that AI policy should transcend political divides. They believe that crafting effective AI legislation requires collaboration between both major political parties.

In targeting this audience, I aim to engage with their existing knowledge and concerns about AI and emphasizing the importance of a bipartisan approach to address the complex challenges and opportunities presented by AI technology - as done by several other developed nations around the world. 

Following this criteria, the people I selected for conducting this User Research were of the following demographic: 

1. Male, Graduate Student, Early 30s, AI Enthusiast
2. Male, Graduate Student, Mid Twenties, Data Science Major
3. Female, Graduate Student, Mid Twenties

### Interview script

For my interviews, I tried to identify the overall first impression of my storyboard, whether the target audience is able to identify the core message, whether the visual elements work in cohesion, and whether the story as a whole makes sense. 

Now, let's look at what happened in the interviews!

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand users' first impressions and overall sentiment |  What is your initial impression of the wireframe and storyboard?|
| Assess if the project's core message is clear and prominent. | Can you easily identify the main message or objective of the project from the wireframe and storyboard? |
| Identify potential areas of confusion or ambiguity in the design. | Are there any elements that are confusing or unclear to you in the wireframe and storyboard?|
| Ensure that visual elements enhance user engagement and understanding. | Are the visual elements, such as images and graphics, engaging and relevant? | 
| Assess the suitability of the chosen color palette. | Is the color scheme appropriate for the project's tone and message? | 
| Determine if users are encouraged to take desired actions. | Are the calls-to-action (CTAs) clear and compelling? |
| Evaluate the overall narrative flow of the design. | Does the wireframe and storyboard flow logically from one section to the next? |
| Identify and address any technical issues that hinder usability. | Are there any technical issues or glitches that you've encountered while interacting with the wireframe and storyboard? |
| Collect actionable feedback for refining the design. | What changes or improvements would you suggest to make the wireframe and storyboard more effective in conveying the message and engaging the target audience? | 


### Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 	What is your initial impression of the wireframe and storyboard? |   The title is a little abstruse for someone who is not in touch with the development of AI. Overall, pretty positive. You're trying to convinvce people to vote for a bill that calls for a clear ethical guideline around AI development, and the creation of a binding, national and international regulatory framework. | The visuals are truly attrative, and I feel drawn in to actually read the text. There's a lot of information, and it feels like it would take some time for me to get it all in. Additionally, the interactive graph helps a lot|  My first impression after going trhrough the whole thing was that it's pretty long. Also, in its current version, it has a lot of words. I feel like there might be opportunities to reduce the number of words. |
| Can you easily identify the main message or objective of the project from the wireframe and storyboard? |  Yes, and no. Yes, in the sense that once I have scrolled through the entire website, I know what you're talking about. However, I felt that you took a bit too long to get to the point.|  Yes. I feel that the main message is pretty clear and concise.| Not really. I feel like given that you have a long introduction, and took a long time to reach the final Call to Action, the drop from 'Oh, AI is the best thing ever' to 'Well, maybe Not!' wasn't too pronounced. I think that you would need to tease it our further.|
|  Are there any elements that are confusing or unclear to you in the wireframe and storyboard?| You talk about an ethical compass, however, there is no mention of an ethical compass anywhere else in the storyboard right now. It feels like you have left that upto interpretation - which in my opinion makes your Call to Action weaker than it should be.|  I felt like the narrative flow a little off. I believe if I were someone who did not keep in touch with the industry, I would need a step-by-step guidance on how to dissect all that you're saying. Like, why is 'Training Computation Size' a good metric for evaluating the growth of AI models? I feel like you can have some more one liner pages in there to dissociate these things. |  Not really. I didn't find anything confusing or unclear outright.|
| Are the visual elements, such as images and graphics, engaging and relevant?| Yes. But I see multiple bar charts right now. Although it makes sense, I feel there could be other graphs that you could try as well. |  I really like the visuals. However, with regards to the 'Major Controversies in AI' graph, it's a little confusing. I don't know if 200 odd cases in a year is a lot, or very little. Additionally, if the number of models being produced increases, isn't it natural that the number of controversies would also increase? I think it would be great if you could quantify how 'major' the major events actually are.| I think where you show the stacked bar, the writing on top of the charts substantiates what the charts say. However, it's not as pronounced as it should be to make me stop scrolling and look at the writing, which is why I missed it when I was looking at it for the first time. Maybe you could do something to make that more pronounced. Also, I don't really understand what the gray dots in the stacked bar charts represent.|
|Is the color scheme appropriate for the projectâ€™s tone and message?|  I think so. I like the dark theme. However, I still think there is a lack of homogenization of the color scheme throughout the page. I don't know what exactly it is that makes me feel this way.|  I like the color scheme, and I think it's pretty consistent throughout. | I like how you used the color blue to separate the website into 2 distinct parts. The rest of the color scheme also seems to work pretty well given the homogenization you created with the colors |
| Are the calls-to-action (CTAs) clear and compelling?|  The Call to Action is clear. However, I feel there is still some room to make it more compelling with other evidence of AI malfeasance, and oversight, and how it affects the people in the US.|  I feel that the CTAs are really concise and convincing. With some additional explanation, I think there is a very good shot at convincing even the people from the proverbial other side of the aisle.|   The CTAs are clear, however, if you could work on making them a little more convincing with some call-out pages, I think that would be really helpful.          |
| Does the wireframe and storyboard flow logically from one section to the next? | Yes. But I think there should be a couple of more guiding slides in-between that take me from one point to another, and walk me through how you would've, if you were explaining it to me. | I think there is a clear narrative for people who understand the field of data science and artificial intelligence. However, for someone who is new to field, I believe there should be a more concise and guarded flow of the narrative. This could include adding pages that explain in one line why you go from one section to another. Additionally, fleshing out why the uncontrolled growth of AI would be detrimental for the general public is something that I think you should consider adding in the final project.| I think so. However, I would like to see you fleshing out the disadvantages of having a rampant, uncontrolled AI a little further.|
|  Are there any technical issues or glitches that youâ€™ve encountered while interacting with the wireframe and storyboard? | Nothin that I could find, no. I feel like reading/interpreting the bar chart race was a little difficult given the speed at which it changed| Not really. But I noticed you have multiple 2019s and 2021s in the stacked bar chart for the survey data. Although they show the same thing, it would be good if you could remove that little discrepancy.|Not really. I think apart from the dots in the stacked bar chart, everything else looks pretty straightforward to me.|
|  What changes or improvements would you suggest to make the wireframe and storyboard more effective in conveying the message and engaging the target audience?| You might try out some different types of visualizations, instead of using the bar plot more than once. Addtionally, as an audience member, I would also like to know how a world without AI ethics impacts the general public. You could use some examples of AI bias - racially and socially and how it's affecting people around the world. |  Like I said, some explanation is needed to get the narrative of the story really flowing like it should. Additionally, you could also maybe have a page that says why and how the uncontrolled growth of AI affects the general populace.| It would be really great if you clean up the legend of the stacked bar charts. Additionally, you could replce the 'Day of Release' to the 'Year of Release' in the first graph regarding the training computation.|


## Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The narrative flow currently is somewhat discontinuous. Especially at the beginning of the project. | In Part III, I aim to add some more connecting slides, that would make the narrative even more clear. With regards to this point, what I'm trying to achieve is that the ShortHand story will speak for itself, without me needing to explain any particular point. |
|  There is a logical gap between how the lack of such an AI bill affects the general populace.|In Part III, I would like to ideally add 2 more slides that describe how the future of the world looks like without supervision in the AI industry. Given that data can be difficult to find for this particular scenario, I am thinking about adding images from various articles, and recent incidents of social and racial bias by different AI systems around the world. |
|  Not clear as to why the uncontrolled growth of AI is harmful for the general public| In Part III, I want to add a page, or maybe two explaining why the uncontrolled growth of AI harms the general public. This would include racial and social bias allegations against well-established AI systems - like the AI systems used by credit reporting agencies to establish whether a person is likely to defualt, etc. |
| Some of the graphs have legends which are messy right now - in the sense thaty they seem to soak away information from the actual analysis.| In Part III, I plan to clean up the legend and axes of the Training Computation bar chart, and the Stacked Bar charts.|
| Too long of an introduction | In Part III, I plan to increase the later half of the project by including How AI could be Harmful to the society if not bounded by laws. This would definitely make the whole project more proportional. |
