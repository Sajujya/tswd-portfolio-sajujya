# Balancing Progress and Principles: Navigating the AI Evolution with an Ethical Compass

### Wireframes / storyboards

I started with defining my target audience, and crafting the story around that particular narrative. My aim in this project is to convince my readers of a need for a Bipartisan AI Bill that demands Responsible Development of AI by all actors involved in the devdelopment and deployment of large scale artificial intelligence systems that would go on to shape the society of tomorrow.

## User research 

### Target audience
My target audience for advocating the need for a Bipartisan Bill on AI consists of the general population of the US who are AI-conscious. I identified them as my target audience through the following criteria:

1. **Interested in AI:** AI-conscious individuals are those who actively follow developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies. They are genuinely interested in the field and its implications for society. Therefore, I have comparatively lesser ground to cover while catching them up with the recent developments in the field. 

2. **Awareness of AI's Impact:** This audience is aware of AI's potential to transform various industries, create economic opportunities, and disrupt existing job markets. They understand both the benefits and challenges associated with AI adoption.

3. **Policy Concerns:** AI-conscious people are concerned about the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. They recognize the need for appropriate regulations and safeguards to ensure AI is used responsibly and safely.

4. **Bipartisanship Advocates:** This audience values bipartisan cooperation in government and understands that AI policy should transcend political divides. They believe that crafting effective AI legislation requires collaboration between both major political parties.

In targeting this audience, I aim to engage with their existing knowledge and concerns about AI and emphasizing the importance of a bipartisan approach to address the complex challenges and opportunities presented by AI technology - as done by several other developed nations around the world. 

### Interview script

For my interviews, I tried to identify the overall first impression of my storyboard, whether the target audience is able to identify the core message, whether the visual elements work in cohesion, and whether the story as a whole makes sense. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand users' first impressions and overall sentiment |  What is your initial impression of the wireframe and storyboard?|
| Assess if the project's core message is clear and prominent. | Can you easily identify the main message or objective of the project from the wireframe and storyboard? |
| Identify potential areas of confusion or ambiguity in the design. | Are there any elements that are confusing or unclear to you in the wireframe and storyboard?|
| Ensure that visual elements enhance user engagement and understanding. | Are the visual elements, such as images and graphics, engaging and relevant? | 
| Assess the suitability of the chosen color palette. | Is the color scheme appropriate for the project's tone and message? | 
| Determine if users are encouraged to take desired actions. | Are the calls-to-action (CTAs) clear and compelling? |
| Evaluate the overall narrative flow of the design. | Does the wireframe and storyboard flow logically from one section to the next? |
| Identify and address any technical issues that hinder usability. | Are there any technical issues or glitches that you've encountered while interacting with the wireframe and storyboard? |
| Collect actionable feedback for refining the design. | What changes or improvements would you suggest to make the wireframe and storyboard more effective in conveying the message and engaging the target audience? |
