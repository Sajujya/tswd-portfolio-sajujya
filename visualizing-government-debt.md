# OECD Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Let's first look at the Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio of some countries for the year 2016.

# Government Debt for Countries between 1995-2021
Now, let's look at the Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio visualized for these countries between the years 1995-2021.

# Top 10 Countries with the Highest Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Now that we have a rough idea of how the Debt-toGDP Ratio of each country has changes from 1995-2021, let's look at the Top 10 countries with the highest government debt-to-GDP ratios for every year.

### Explanation
1. Here, I started with modifying the data in Excel to create a Pivot table, with the columns as the year values and the rows as the country codes. The value in each cell would now correspond to the value of the debt-to-GDP ratio for that country for that year.

2. I imported this data into flourish and started off with a bar-chart race template to create the current visualization.

3. As a sidenote, I would have wanted to color the chart differently. Ideally, I would have wanted a gray-to-red diverging color scale to get the point across that highesr ratios of debt-to-GDP are a sign of failing economies. However, current;y, I do not think that Flourish offers that flexibility in terms of colors.

# Comparing and Contrasing the Visualizations

| Bar Chart | Grid of Line Charts | Bar Chart Race |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- | 
| This chart is simple and easy to understand. However, it does not provide any context as to how the  debt-to-GDP ratio for the different countries has changed over the years. Therefore, at the risk of simplicity, this chart has had to do away with a lot of contextual information. However, if we just want to see the data for a particular year, this is the one that makes the most sense. | This gives us an idea of how the debt-to-GDP ratio has changed for each country between 1995-2021. However, personally, I am not a fan of grid of line charts since often times it feels like information overload.| This graphic shows us what were the top 10 worst performing countries in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio for each year from 1995-2021. Therefore, this answers a different question from the other two, because it compares countries parallelly, over the years, and returns the top 10. Ideally, like how I mentioned, I would like the color scheme to represent the fact that highest debt-to-GDP ratios are a warning sign   |
